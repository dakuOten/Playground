    content:
      "React uses a Virtual DOM (Document Object Model), which is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM. When changes are made, React updates the Virtual DOM first, then calculates the minimal set of updates needed to reflect changes in the real DOM. This process is called reconciliation and makes React very efficient.",
